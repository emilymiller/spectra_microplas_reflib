# spectra_microplas_reflib user instructions

A reference library of Raman spectra for marine microplastic identification

Assumes spectra files are separate .csvs for each specimen (and wave number when relevant). The below is the repo organization.


Start with spectra processing scripts:
1) cleaning_code.R
2) preprocessing.R

Then use the derived data file to follow matching protocol:
3) technical_valid_weathered.R

Remaining scripts in repo are used for constructing figures in Miller et al. and for applications with this reference library.
